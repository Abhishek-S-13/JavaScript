Abstraction : Abstraction means hiding the internal details and showing only the functionality.
Encapsulation: Encapsulation means keeping the internal state private and providing controlled access through methods.
Inheritance: Inheritance lets a class inherit properties and methods from another class.
Polymorphism: Polymorphism means methods behave differently based on the object calling them.
